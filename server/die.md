   - **Status Updates:** Real-time updates to task statuses as they are moved across the board.

5. **Notifications and Reminders:**
   - **Email Notifications:** Users receive email notifications for important events like task assignments, due date reminders, and project updates.
   - **In-App Notifications:** Real-time in-app notifications for various actions and updates.

6. **Comments and Collaboration:**
   - **Task Comments:** Users can add comments to tasks for discussions and clarifications.
   - **Mentions:** Users can mention team members in comments to notify them directly.

7. **File Attachments:**
   - **Upload Files:** Users can attach files to tasks for easy access to relevant documents and resources.

8. **Reporting and Analytics:**
   - **Task Reports:** Generate reports on task completion, pending tasks, and performance metrics.
   - **Project Analytics:** Insights into project progress, deadlines, and team productivity.

9. **User Roles and Permissions:**
   - **Role Management:** Different roles like admin, manager, and team member with specific permissions.
   - **Access Control:** Fine-grained control over who can view, edit, or delete tasks and projects.

10. **Search and Filters:**
    - **Search Functionality:** Users can search for tasks and projects by keywords.
    - **Advanced Filters:** Filter tasks by due date, priority, status, tags, and assigned users.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend:**
  - **Framework:** Symfony
  - **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL
  - **ORM:** Doctrine ORM
  - **Authentication:** Symfony Security Component
  - **API:** Symfony API Platform or custom RESTful API

- **Frontend:**
  - **Framework:** Vue.js, React, or Angular
  - **State Management:** Vuex (for Vue.js), Redux (for React), or NgRx (for Angular)
  - **UI Components:** Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or Material-UI

- **Deployment:**
  - **Web Server:** Nginx or Apache
  - **Containerization:** Docker
  - **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins
  - **Hosting:** AWS, DigitalOcean, or Heroku

## Development Steps

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Set up the Symfony project and configure the environment.
   - Create the database schema using Doctrine.

2. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user registration, login, and profile management.
   - Secure the application using Symfony Security Component.

3. **Project and Task Management:**
   - Develop models and controllers for projects and tasks.
   - Create views and forms for adding and managing projects and tasks.

4. **Kanban Board:**
   - Implement the drag-and-drop interface using a frontend framework.
   - Integrate the Kanban board with the backend to update task statuses in real-time.

5. **Notifications and Collaboration:**
   - Set up email and in-app notifications.
   - Enable commenting and file attachments on tasks.

6. **Reporting and Analytics:**
   - Create endpoints and views for generating reports.
   - Integrate charts and graphs for visual analytics.

7. **User Roles and Permissions:**
   - Define user roles and permissions.
   - Implement access control based on roles.

8. **Testing and Deployment:**
